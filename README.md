# Chatbot_python
End to end chatbot using Python 

This is my attempt to work on building an End to end chatbot using python. 
Fascianted by the power of Chatgpt, I wanted to explore the world of LLM.
This project helped me understand the topics of Vectorization and how the model is trained. 

This is also my first exposure to streamlit and exploring its features. Even though this is a basic application as shown below, it gave good understanding of strealit's features.
